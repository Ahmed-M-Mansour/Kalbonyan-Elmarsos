# 9- Programming Foundations: Software Testing/QA

# Quality Assurance

```jsx
- Quality Assurance  : A systematic process used to determine whether
                       a product meets a specifications 

- QA  == QA Engineer  == Tester 

- Primary goal: Helps their team move quickly with confidence  

- How to ensure quality? 
 - clear specifications 
 - code implemented 
 - code tested 
 - code released 

- Technica Aptitude : [ Manual testing , Automated testing  , programming ] 
- Business knoladge : [ Feature scoping , Test planing ,
                        test case management , Bug management ] 

- DevOps : [ configure tools , set up CI , set up test environment , Automate process ] 

- SDLC: [ plan , define, design ,  build , test , deploy ] 

- Plan: [ identify risks , identify use cases ] 
- Define: [ write specifications and acceptance criteria ,
            decide what is in scope , 
            write test strategy  ] 
- Design and Build : [ solidify test scenrioes  , 
                       get feedbackon on scenarios from team , 
                       manual and automation tests ] 
- Test : [  manual and automation tests , Acceptance testing ] 
- Deploy : [ validate functionality  , release , test in production ] 
 
```

# Test Planning

```jsx
- Acceptance criteria : condition that a software product must satisfy to be 
                       accepted by a stakeholder 
- test strategy: [ QA deliverables , Scope of testing , Refrences ] 

- The definition of done specifies when testing is complete 
```

# Type of Testing QA Focuses On

```jsx
- Types of Balck Box Testing   [  Manual , UI Automation ]   --> QA Engineer 
- Gray Box Testing   -->  examines the interaction between the outside and inside of a box.
- White Box Testing  -->  Focus on the internals of the application  
- Types of White Box Testing  [ Unit Testing , system testing ] 

- Integration Testing: focus on the interaction between application components 
  : For [ browser , server , database ] 

                         - Performance Testing - 

- Load Testing : check the application`sability to perform under user loads
- Endurance Testing : how an  application handle load over time 
- Stress Testing : identify thebreaking points of an application 
                   is to measure software stability 

                          - Security Testing - 
- SQL injection
- DOS Attack  --> Denial of service   --> Try to take down server or network 
 
```

# Bug Reporting

```jsx
- Severity: How impactful the bug is to the business 
- priority:  How fast the bug should be fixed 

- What details should a bug report include?
 [ actual result ,  name of the bug ,   expected result  ]

```
